# GoGet README

GoGet : A Extention for go devolopers to make life easy, auto download and auto sync the repos

## Features

-Downloads the repos directly from github and saves into local GOROOTPATH.
-Automatically runs on workspace startup and scan the workspace.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[GoGet\]\(images/goget_logo.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

-A good workspace of go files

-If autostart not working try to run using Ctrl+Shift+P ==> "GoGet : Start "
